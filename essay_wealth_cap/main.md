(sue) so the first step is to collect all the things we've written on wealth caps:

- nothing is stopping somebody from avoiding the wealth cap by just giving it to their friends and loved ones
- So really, the only disincentive to wealth creation is from the people who want to accumulate a bunch of power for themselves
- "nobody gets to a billion dollars without breaking some ethical code of capitalism, violating some law that exists for good reason, or doing something that should've been illegal"
- also like "you should have at most 50 billion" isn't a human rights violation
- "we're all a bunch of socialists"
- restricting freedoms is not inherently illiberal, because the tradeoff is that it promotes more freedoms in other areas
- past a certain point, it just becomes dream hoarding and goes too hard against the ideal of equal opportunity that we all claim to believe in
- median individual wealth in the world is 100k, and 100 million dollars of wealth is more than enough to create a dynasty that is almost forever separated and privileged over the rest of society

we only have enough material for like, a quarter of an essay
maybe we can pad it with complaints about windsor, colorado

chatgpt summarized this:

Disincentives for Wealth Hoarding:

    A wealth cap won't eliminate wealth creation but discourages the hoarding of excessive wealth beyond a reasonable cap.
    Wealth caps still allow for redistribution to family, friends, or loved ones, reducing the concentration of resources in individual hands.

Ethical and Legal Boundaries:

    The argument suggests that immense wealth accumulation often involves ethical compromises or navigating laws that should have been more stringent.
    There’s a critique of billionaires and how they achieve such massive fortunes, implying societal harm or exploitation in the process.

Rights and Wealth Limits:

    Limiting wealth isn’t a violation of human rights; the statement challenges the moral grounds for owning extreme amounts of wealth while maintaining fairness and equality.

Philosophical Perspective on Wealth:

    Beyond a certain point, wealth transitions into excessive hoarding and disrupts ideals of equal opportunity and social justice.
    Hoarding of wealth also contradicts collective claims about promoting fairness and accessibility for all in society.

Proposed Wealth Cap Threshold:

    Suggests a median individual wealth cap worldwide (around $100K) and proposes that $7M is more than sufficient for generational security and legacy.
    Emphasizes that this cap would prevent the formation of dynasties with disproportionate privilege and influence over societal norms.


I can ask chatgpt for help on how to structure this essay, or I can use the most dangerous writing app to spit out something sane, and I can just write for ten minutes straight?


# The most dangerous writing app

[I wrote this in one shot using this one-shot essay writer, called the most dangerous writing app that basically nukes all my progress if i take too long to write. used hardcore mode to get past the mental block.](https://www.squibler.io/dangerous-writing-prompt-app/write?limit=10&type=minutes&hardcore=true)

elon musk is a fucking cunt. he's making shit worse for all of us. he honestly should kill himself, but this isn't going to be easy because he's really reach. 

a spectre is ahunting society: thethe spectre of gross wealth accumulation.

"No one Man Should Have All That Power"

"You're alla  bunch of socialists!
- Luidwig von mises

uhh what other quotes do we have?

i that quote about absolute power corrupts absolutely.

We all claim to support equal access to education. We all claim tos upport equal access to basic resources so everyone can be raised on a level playing field. That being said, we all want our children to have advantages and to succeed in life, and so we all strike a balance somwehere along the line when it comes to how much we grant benefits to our children and how much wvs to any random person.

Brookings institution had that online game called the ladder which really shows the tension ofthat a good, intellectually honest liberal faces when it comes to raising a family: 

How much power, how much inequality in opportunity are we morally and ethnically justified in granting to our blood and kin?

I argue that this makes things difficult if we don'

Uhhhhhhh. I think this is bad if we were to end up with landed nobility. I think we should skim "If You're an egalitarioan, how come you're so rich?"

what about referencing some parts of vie dfor singapore when they had land seizures to essentially undo generations of calcified wealth hhoarding in exchange fo, athe outcome of generations and generations of moral compromise, choosing a just a bit more inequality to serve the noble, honorable, loving goal of giving our child and advantage and securing their legacy.but we do know that too much inquality is bad already, - we've seen that walkt disney bitch who was like "yeah my parents were nice but then then tempatation of getting that sweet sweet private jet was too much for them, and then they turned into assholes."

rthat wealth inequality threatens to create a division and and isolation from the rest of humanity which hurts us all. 

(note to self: i probably shouldn't add in my personal storybut i think i can turn this into a live story somewhow"

this is going to be tricky. 

because my dad grew up on food stamps. he got a lot of free college. he bbenefitted from California's welfare state and now he rails against it in spite of the fact that today's welfare state, with benefits and everything, hare less than what he had when he grew up. He forgot where he came from as a result of rising so high!

listne, we all know that success (financial or otherwise) is both an outcome of hard work *and* luck. 

svery few people choose to have their life turned around by blosing the ability to move after being hit by a car. very few people choose to, like, try ing where they have a child that ends up needing hundreds of hours extra a month to take care of the,


(oh! I ahve an idea!) the strucro this could be something like, "1. Too much inequality is bad"

and then show a gradient of a gini coefficient, or at least the difference in wealth between the poorest person in society and the richest person in society.

2.  Really, the discussion is about where the line should be

3. the line should be somewhere here
