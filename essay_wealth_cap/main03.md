# Against Wealth

> **Government Employee:** S-sir, I'm afraid you've gone mad with power...

- The inherent tension between equal opportunity and dynasty-building
- Reference to the Brookings Institution "ladder" game showing this tension
- [Need more development of foundational argument]
- restricting freedoms is not inherently illiberal, because the tradeoff is that it promotes more freedoms in other areas
- past a certain point, it just becomes dream hoarding and goes too hard against the ideal of equal opportunity that we all claim to believe in

## The Interpersonal Cost of Unlimited Wealth

- Your point about isolation from humanity
- The Disney heir anecdote
- Your personal story about welfare state benefits
- [Need broader evidence/examples]

- "But this discourages wealth creation" 
- "This violates rights"
- "You're all socialists"
- [Need to develop these counterarguments more fully]
- nothing is stopping somebody from avoiding the wealth cap by just giving it to their friends and loved ones

Windsor, Colorado is a microcosm of these perils which befall those who do not take wealth seriously.

Moral rot, intellectual atrophy, isolation from humanity - all of these qualities can be found along the temporarily-embarassed dynasties that can be found incubating in the whitespoken residencies of Raindance and Pelican Shores, poisioned by the six privately-owned golf courses that have desecrated the natural landscape. After all, the designers of this Matrix have crafted a [saccharine, gilded utopia](https://urbanland.uli.org/a-brief-history-of-racial-zoning-neighborhood-associations-and-municipal-zoning) where poor people have little opportunity to fraternize and possibly taint the rising nobility.

Even the *suggestion* of poverty and struggle is enough to frighten the decayed minds of the town's residencies: Boardwalk Park, Windsor's flagship greenspace that lays adjacent to their beloved lake, dealt with a controversy involving a statue of a woman and a few children. The issue? Residents were concerned with the implication of single motherhood, leading the city to eventually add a statue of a man to smooth over concerns.

One of the most prominent men in town, Jim Cosner, is a respected politician in spite of being forced to resign from a quasi-government institution in disgrace. Why, we must wonder, is Jim Cosner revered in spite of having secretly bought land in the hopes of convincing his fellow board members at the Downtown Development Board to purchase it and guarantee a profit for him? Perhaps the residents care less about *how* the wealth was made and more about *who* has it.

A single mother explains that life in the town was wonderful *before* her divorce, having owned a luxurious lakeside home and enjoying the trappings that this city had promised her. Post-divorce, having slipped a few rungs down the ladder to the American dream, she is disillusioned. The social safety net that any self-respecting society should be proud to provide is begrudgingly, sparingly given to her household by the city of Windsor, Colorado. She is exhausted, working seventy-hour weeks to provide for her children. This, of course, is not counting the time she'd spent coaching her children on how to navigate the cruelty of the adults running the school system - for whatever reason, they seemed to think less of children living in a one-parent household. This number definitely does not account for the time spent homeschooling her children to shield them from the abuse.

There are outsiders, such as teachers who must travel from adjacent cities for the privilege of educating the next generation of aristocrats: They are disgusted by what they observe, with one even disavowing the town as a "vapid black hole in Northern Colorado where the children are devoid of wit, intelligence, or charm."

Many parents who have made a home in Windsor, Colorado, did so to play host to their children's rise to enlightenment and security. Hopefully, each one will discover the parasitism in time to rescue the soul of their bloodline.
