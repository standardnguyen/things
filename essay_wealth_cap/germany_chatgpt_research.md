The metric you're referring to is commonly called the **"Wealth Multiple"** or **"Median Wealth Ratio."** It measures an individual's wealth in relation to the **median wealth** of their country. 

### **Formula:**
\[
\text{Wealth Multiple} = \frac{\text{Individual Wealth}}{\text{Median Wealth of Country}}
\]

### **Example Calculation:**
- If someone has **$1,000,000** in net wealth and the median wealth in their country is **$100,000**, their **wealth multiple** is:
  \[
  1,000,000 \div 100,000 = 10
  \]
  This means they have **10× the median wealth** of their country.

### **Why Use This Metric?**
- It provides a **relative** measure of wealth rather than an absolute one.
- Helps compare wealth across different economic conditions and countries.
- Highlights inequality better than just looking at raw wealth numbers.

This metric is often used in **economic inequality studies**, though it doesn’t have a universally standardized name. Economists sometimes frame it in the context of **relative wealth inequality** or **wealth percentiles**.

In **1935**, the richest man in Germany was likely **Gustav Krupp von Bohlen und Halbach**, the head of the **Krupp steel and armaments empire**. His wealth came from **Friedrich Krupp AG**, Germany’s largest industrial conglomerate, which played a crucial role in rearming the country under Hitler’s regime.

### **Gustav Krupp’s Wealth in 1935**:
- The **Krupp family** was estimated to have a fortune of at least **100–200 million Reichsmarks** in the mid-1930s.
- Adjusted for today’s money, this would be roughly **$5–10 billion USD** when considering inflation and asset growth.
- His company, **Friedrich Krupp AG**, had an immense industrial empire, controlling steel production, arms manufacturing, and key war industries.
  
### **Other Major Wealthy Germans in 1935**:
1. **Fritz Thyssen** – **Steel and coal magnate**  
   - Initially a Nazi supporter, Thyssen was a key financier of Hitler’s rise. His **Thyssen Group** had assets worth hundreds of millions of Reichsmarks.
   
2. **Hugo Stinnes (deceased by 1924, family still influential)** – **Industrialist in coal, steel, and shipping**  
   - Stinnes had built a vast empire before his death, but his heirs remained powerful.

3. **Otto Wolff von Amerongen (Wolff Group)** – **Steel and industrialist family**  
   - His company had close Nazi ties and was involved in war production.

4. **The Quandt Family** – **Battery and industrial empire (precursor to BMW control)**  
   - Guenther Quandt and his family were among the wealthiest due to arms production and business expansion under Nazi policies.

### **Conclusion**:
While Gustav Krupp was likely **the single richest individual**, the **combined wealth of the Krupp, Thyssen, and Quandt industrial dynasties** made them the most powerful economic families of Nazi Germany. By 1935, many of them had significantly **profited from Nazi rearmament policies**, which funneled government contracts into their businesses.

Finding exact data on **median wealth in Germany in 1935** is challenging because historical wealth distribution data was not as systematically recorded as it is today. However, we can estimate based on available economic indicators:

1. **GDP per capita (1935)**:  
   - Germany’s **GDP per capita** in 1935 was approximately **3,000–4,000 Reichsmarks (RM)**.  
   - Adjusted for purchasing power, this was roughly equivalent to **$8,000–$10,000 in today’s USD**.

2. **Wealth Distribution Trends**:  
   - Wealth was highly **unequally distributed**, with large landowners and industrialists holding a disproportionate share.  
   - The **Gini coefficient** for wealth (not just income) was likely **above 0.60**, meaning a significant concentration at the top.  
   - Many workers and lower-middle-class individuals had **minimal savings or assets**, as economic instability (hyperinflation of the 1920s and the Great Depression) had eroded personal wealth.

3. **Median Household Wealth Estimate**:  
   - Based on income data and known disparities in wealth, a reasonable estimate for **median household wealth** in Germany around 1935 would be **5,000–10,000 Reichsmarks**.  
   - In today’s money, that might be around **$20,000–$50,000 USD** in assets (land, savings, small businesses, etc.).  
   - Many working-class households had **very little accumulated wealth**, while wealthier segments, particularly Nazi elites and industrialists, accumulated more assets.
