eighty years ago, liberals watched in horror as their ideology of freedom did little to stop the atrocities committed by Adolf Hitler. the uh, their ideology had allowed for corporations to accumulate vast amounts of power and they were okay with that in the name of wealth accumulation. anyway they ended up destroying capitalism and creating cartels.

now, the richest man in the world is a nazi with nazi employees. (links to nazis), throwing the sieg heil to his followers.

okay one line is: we [mock](mussolini), [despise](hitler), and [distrust](trump) politicians who believe that they alone can be trusted with immense government power, which is why we celebrate democracy and advocate for so many checks and balances around the state's monopoly on violence. why do we grant a pass to rich people who trust themselves to solely wield immense financial power?
